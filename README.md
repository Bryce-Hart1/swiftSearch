# swiftSearch
This is my multithreaded-focused project, which I will be using to show my knowledge of multithreading and OOP in C++ 
The main goal of this project is to show ADT design and multithreading to create runtime-effective searching. 

To start, you will enter a command. This command will include the directory you are working on and the operation
that you would like to perform on it.

The possible operations start with # when entering the command line, and they are as follows:

#sortedList - takes all numbers and sorts them into a printable file, smallest to largest
#-sortedList - takes all numbers and sorts them into a printable file, largest to smallest (reversed)
#listNumbers - takes all numbers and sorts them into a file in the order they appear
#listWords - takes all the words in the file and displays them in the order they appear.
#findCharacterFrequency - finds the frequency of all values
#findWordFreq - finds the frequency of all words in the list
